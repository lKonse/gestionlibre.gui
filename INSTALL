# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

# Application dependencies
You must have the following software installed in order to
install GestiónLibre:

web2py - http://www.web2py.com
wxPython (wx for short) for the desktop interface - http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/
gui2py -http://code.google.com/p/gui2py/

# Installation with .zip archive

1 Unzip archive in your system user home folder
2 Open a terminal in your system (run -> cmd for win)
3 From the new extracted application folder
  run this command:

>python setup.py --install

If there are no errors in console output, you have now a working copy of GestiónLibre in your system

# Installation from the mercurial repository
1 make a clone of the project "gestionlibre_gui" in your system
  From a terminal run:

>hg clone https://code.google.com/p/gestionlibre.gui/ ./gestionlibre

2 Inside the new created folder run:

>python setup.py --install

# Alternative no_gui installation

There is an installation mode wich disables the gui interface for install GestiónLibre in case you
cannot run a desktop environment. The target system still needs the before mentioned dependencies (wx, web2py and gui2py)
and the script will exit with an error code if they are not satisfied. Note that this script waits for user input during installation

from the gestionlibre unzipped/downloaded folder run:

>python setup.py --install --no_gui
